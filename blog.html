            1. What is the Document Object Model (DOM)?
          </div>
          <div class="collapse-content text-justify text-lg font-semibold">
            <p>
              The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface that
              represents the structure of web documents, such as HTML and XML,
              as a hierarchical tree of objects. Each node in the tree
              corresponds to different parts of the document, including
              elements, attributes, and text. This model allows developers to
              dynamically manipulate content, structure, and style on a web page
              using JavaScript, enabling real-time updates without full page
              reloads. The DOM facilitates event handling, allowing developers
              to create interactive web applications by responding to user
              actions like clicks and keyboard input. It is designed to be
              cross-platform and language-independent, although JavaScript is
              the primary language used to interact with it due to its seamless
              integration with web browsers. Additionally, the DOM is
              standardized by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), ensuring
              consistency across different browsers. This standardization
              simplifies the development process and helps create reliable web
              applications that function across various platforms. Overall, the
              DOM is crucial for building dynamic and interactive web
              experiences, giving developers control over the structure and
              behavior of web pages programmatically.

            2. How do you select an element from the DOM?
          </div>
          <div class="collapse-content text-justify text-lg font-semibold">
            <p>
              Selecting elements from the Document Object Model (DOM) is crucial
              for dynamic web page manipulation using JavaScript. Several
              methods facilitate this process: <br />
              1. getElementById: Retrieves a single element based on its unique
              ID, allowing direct access to that specific element. <br />
              2. getElementsByClassName: Selects all elements that share a
              specified class name, returning a live HTMLCollection that updates
              automatically as the document changes. <br />
              3. getElementsByTagName: Similar to the class name method, this
              selects elements by their tag name, also returning a live
              HTMLCollection, which can be useful for accessing groups of
              elements. <br />
              4. querySelector: This versatile method selects the first element
              matching a specified CSS selector. It returns a single element or
              null if no match exists, making it straightforward for targeted
              selections. <br />
              5. querySelectorAll: This method retrieves all elements matching a
              given CSS selector, returning a static NodeList that does not
              update with changes in the document.

            3. What is event delegation in the context of the DOM, and why is it
            useful?
          </div>
          <div class="collapse-content text-justify text-lg font-semibold">
            <p>
              Event delegation is a DOM manipulation technique that allows a
              single event listener to manage events for multiple child elements
              by attaching it to a common parent element. Instead of assigning
              individual listeners to each child element, this method leverages
              the event bubbling mechanism, where an event triggered on a child
              element propagates upward to its parent. When an event occurs, the
              parent listener can respond to it, effectively handling events for
              all child elements, including those added dynamically after the
              listener has been set up.It reduces the total number of event
              listeners, which can enhance performance, especially when dealing
              with many child elements.Newly added child elements automatically
              inherit the parents event listener, eliminating the need for
              additional setup.By centralizing event handling logic, event
              delegation reduces complexity, making the codebase easier to
              maintain.

            4. How do you manipulate an element's attributes and styles using
            the DOM?
          </div>
          <div class="collapse-content text-justify text-lg font-semibold">
            <p>
              Manipulating an element's attributes and styles in the DOM can be
              accomplished using various JavaScript methods and properties.
              <br />
              <br />
              Attribute Manipulation: <br />
              <br />
              getAttribute: This method retrieves the value of a specified
              attribute from an element. For example,
              element.getAttribute('attributeName') returns the current value.
              <br />
              setAttribute: This sets or updates the value of a specified
              attribute. If the attribute does not exist, it will be created.
              For instance, element.setAttribute('attributeName', 'newValue')
              sets the attribute to a new value. <br />
              removeAttribute: This method removes a specified attribute from
              the element, allowing for cleaner HTML when necessary. For
              example, element.removeAttribute('attributeName'). <br />
              Direct Property Access: Some attributes can be accessed directly
              as properties, such as element.id = 'newId' to change the
              element's ID or element.className = 'newClass' to update its
              class. <br />
              <br />
              Style Manipulation: <br />
              <br />
              style Property: You can manipulate an elements inline styles using
              the style property. For example, element.style.color = 'red'
              changes the text color to red. <br />
              By using these methods and properties, developers can dynamically
              modify both the attributes and styles of DOM elements, enhancing
              interactivity and responsiveness in web applications.
